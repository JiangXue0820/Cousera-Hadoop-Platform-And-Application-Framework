- Assignment Week 4 Lesson 2: Joining Data

## [Week 5: Spark](https://www.coursera.org/learn/hadoop/home/week/5)
The Week 5 course focuses on the Apache Spark cluster computing framework. Spark provides great performance advantages over Hadoop MapReduce,especially for iterative algorithms. Also, gives Data Scientists an easier way to write their analysis pipeline in Python and Scala,even providing interactive shells to play live with data.
